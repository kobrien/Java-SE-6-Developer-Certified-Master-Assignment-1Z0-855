<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><I>Where this document uses the word
&quot;must&quot; an absolute requirement is being described. If you
fail to adhere to such a requirement, your assignment will be failed
automatically, and without further evaluation. It is therefore
imperative that you pay close attention to any statement using the

<H2 CLASS="western"><A NAME="what_this"></A>Application Overview</H2>
<H3 CLASS="western">Background</H3>
<P>Bodgitt and Scarper, LLC. is a broker of home improvement
contractors. They take requests from home owners for a type of
service, and offer the homeowner one or more contractors that can
provide the required services. Curently, Bodgitt and Scarper provides
this service over the phone using a team of customer service
representatives (CSRs). The CSRs interact with an ageing
custom-written application that has been drawing increasing criticism
from the CSRs. In the future, Bodgitt and Scarper wants to move into
Internet-based marketing, and hopes to be able to provide their
services directly to customers over the web. 
</P>
<P>The company's IT director has decided to migrate the existing
application to a Java technology based system. Initially, the system
will support only the CSRs, although the hope is that this interim
step will give them a starting point for migrating the system to the
web. The IT director does not anticipate much reuse of the first Java
technology system, but intends to use that system as a learning
exercise before going on to a web based system. 
</P>
<P>The company's IT department has a data file that contains the
essential information for the company, but because the data must
continue to be manipulated for reports using another custom-written
application, the new system must reimplement the database code from
scratch without altering the data file format. 
</P>
<P>The new application, using the existing data file format, must
allow the CSRs to generate a list of constractors that match a
customer's criteria. This is the project that you have been
commissioned to implement. 
</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">What you must do</H3>
<P>The following are the &quot;top level&quot; features that must be
implemented: 
</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A client program with a graphical
	user interface that connects to the database 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A data access system that provides
	record locking and a flexible search mechanism 
	</P>
	<LI><P>Network server functionality for the database system 
	</P>
</UL>
<P>The work involves a number of design choices that have to be made.
In all such cases, the following principles should be applied. 
</P>
<H4 CLASS="western">Clarity and Maintainability</H4>
<DL>
	<DD STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">A clear design, such as will be
	readily understood by junior programmers, will be preferred to a
	complex one, even if the complex one is a little more efficient.
	Code complexity, including nesting depth, argument passing, and the
	number of classes and interfaces, should be reasonable. 
	</DD></DL>
<H4 CLASS="western">
Documentation</H4>
<DL>
	<DD>The code itself should be as clear as possible; do not provide
	comments that do not add to the comprehensibility of the code.
	Awkward or complex code should have descriptive comments, and
	javadoc style comments must be used for each element of the public
	interface of each class. You must create a full suite of
	documentation for the classes of the completed project. This must be
	generated using the tool &quot;javadoc&quot; and must be in HTML
	format.&nbsp; Provide javadoc documentation for all classes you
	write. 
	</DD><DD STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">
	You must provide basic user documentation. This should be sufficient
	to allow a user who is familiar with the broad purpose of the
	project to use the application. This documentation must be in one of
	these three formats: 
	</DD></DL>

</UL>
<H4 CLASS="western">Correctness</H4>
<DL>
	<DT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Your project must conform to this
	specification.&nbsp; Features that deviate from specification will
	not receive full credit.&nbsp; You will not receive extra credit
	points for work beyond the requirements of the specification. 
	</DT></DL>
<H4 CLASS="western">
Use of Standard Elements</H4>
<P>Use of functionality provided by the core Java classes will be
preferred to your own implementation of that functionality, unless
there is a specific advantage to providing your own implementation.</P>

<HR>
<H2 CLASS="western"><A NAME="arch"></A>Overall Architecture</H2>
<H3 CLASS="western">Major Components</H3>
<P>The main architecture of the application must be a traditional
client-server system. There are three key parts:&nbsp; the
server-side data management system, the client-side GUI, and the
network connection between the two. 
</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Non-Networked Mode</H3>
<P>The program must be able to work in a non-networked mode. In this
mode, the database and GUI must run in the same VM and must perform
no networking, must not use loopback networking, and must not involve
the serialization of any objects when communicating between the GUI
and database elements. 
</P>
<P>The operating mode is selected using the single command line
argument that is permitted. Architecturally, this mode must use the
database and GUI from the networked form, but must not use the
network server code at all. 
</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Network Communication Approach</H3>
<P>You have a choice regarding the network connection protocol. You
must use either serialized objects over a simple socket connection,
or RMI.&nbsp; Both options are equally acceptable.&nbsp; Keep in mind
that networking must be entirely bypassed in the non-networked mode. 
</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Restrictions on RMI</H3>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">To avoid unnecessary complexity in the
marking environment certain restrictions are placed on solutions that
use RMI.&nbsp; Specifically: <BR>&nbsp; 
</P>
<UL>

<H2 CLASS="western"><A NAME="UI"></A>The User Interface</H2>
<P>The user interface for this assignment must satisfy the following
criteria: 
</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It must be composed exclusively
	with components from the Java Foundation Classes (Swing components).
		</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It must allow the user to search
	the data for all records, or for records where the name and/or
	location fields exactly match values specified by the user.

	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It must allow the user to book a
	selected record, updating the database file accordingly. 
	</P>
	<LI><P>The program must allow the user to specify the location of
	the database in both standalone and network mode and persist the db
	configuration details in suncertify.properties file. The application
	must read the properties file to determine the location of the db
	and display the data from the db.

<P>Your user interface should be designed with the expectation of
future functionality enhancements, and it should establish a
framework that will support this with minimal disruption to the users
when this occurs.

<H3 CLASS="western">Locking</H3>
<P>Your server must be capable of handling multiple concurrent
requests, and as part of this capability, must provide locking
functionality as specified in the interface provided above.&nbsp; You
may assume that at any moment, at most one program is accessing the
database file; therefore your locking system only needs to be
concerned with multiple concurrent clients of your server.&nbsp; Any
attempt to lock a resource that is already locked should cause the
current thread to give up the CPU, consuming no CPU cycles until the
desired resource becomes available.

<H2 CLASS="western" ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="marking"></A>Marking</H2>
<P>This section describes how your submission will be marked, and the
marking criteria which govern allocation of marks for the Sun
Certified Developer for the Java 2 platform application submission.
The first part describes the marking process, and the second
describes how the marks are allocated. 
</P>
<P><B>How The Assignment is Marked</B> 
</P>
<P>The marking is done in three phases.&nbsp; First, software checks
that overall structure and nomenclature conform to specification.&nbsp;
Second the examiner runs the code ensuring that it functions
correctly through the specified operations. If any automatic failures
are noted at this stage, the marking process terminates and the
assignment is failed. 
</P>
<P>Provided the essential behavioral requirements of the assignment
have been correctly implemented, the examiner proceeds to investigate
the design and implementation of your assignment. This process is
time consuming, and it is because this is done carefully and
thoroughly that submissions take time to grade. The grading process
is closely controlled to ensure consistency and fairness, and it is
performed according to criteria detailed in the next section. At any
time during this process, if an automatic failure is noted, the
marking process terminates, and the assignment is failed. For any
design choice concerning topics not specifically described in the
requirements, marks are awarded for a clear and consistent approach,
rather than for any particular solution. Design decisions must be
described <I>briefly but clearly</I> in your comments. 
</P>
<P>In addition to the submission, you will be required to take a
written examination. This exam tests your understanding of your
submission and asks you to justify a number of design choices
embodied in that submission. 
</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Automatic Failures</H3>
<P><I>As noted at the beginning of this document, where this document
uses the word &quot;must&quot; an absolute requirement is being
described. If you fail to adhere to such a requirement, your
assignment will be failed automatically, and without further
evaluation. It is therefore imperative that you pay close attention
to any statement using the word &quot;must&quot; in this document.</I>
</P>

<H2 CLASS="western" ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="whattodo"></A>What to do if
you have a question</H2>
<P>You might find that you want to ask for further explanation of
some part of this document, perhaps to seek permission to solve a
problem in a particular way. This document deliberately leaves some
issues unspecified, and some problems unraised. Your ability to think
through these issues, in the face of realistically imperfect
specifications, and come to a tenable solution is something upon
which you are being graded. 
</P>
<P>In general, you should <I>not</I> ask your question; rather you
should consider the options available and make a decision about how
to address the problem yourself. This decision-making process is part
of the marking scheme, and as such it is crucially important that you
provide documentation of your choice. Be sure to describe the options
you considered, the perceived benefits and weaknesses of each, and
why you chose the solution you did. Provided you do not contravene
any specification in this document you will not be marked on the
particular choice that you made, but rather on the consistency of
your decision making process and your adherence to other aspects of
these notes during that decision making process. 
</P>
<P>If you feel you must ask your question, you should address it to
who2contact@sun.com. Clearly indicate that the question relates to
the Sun Certified Developer Exam, provide your candidate ID number,
name, and include your return email address in the <I>body</I> of
your message. Describe your issue as briefly as reasonably possible;
you will be asked for more information if necessary.
